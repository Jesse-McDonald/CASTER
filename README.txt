CASTER is a programm called Computer Assisted Segmentation Tool Environment Revisit, and has been developed for the segmentation of neves with in stacks of Scanning Electron Microscope scans of retina
caster is currently indev and is not ready to be used as a standalone system, but it does make a good platform for testing automatic and semi-automatic segmentation tools
the current plan is to attempt to make CASTER a fully functioning program and eventually port it from Processing to another language in the C/Java family

FEATURES:
Import and display multiple sequential images representing SEM scans in png format 
Navigation of image stack
Easily Modifiable code for rapid testing of tools
Brush style Segmentation
Saving and loading overlays in JEMO format
RAE CAST ray segmentation semi-automatic segmentation brush
EdgeDetection brush for semi-automatic and automatic selection of membrain
Landmark alignment
