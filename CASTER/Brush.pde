/**
Brush is designed to provide a simple brush to draw with, brush depends on having
a global EMImage called this.img for some of its functionality and should only exist
as a member of that object
Brush is now polymorphic, new brushes should simply extend Brush and replace img.brush when in use, this replaces mode in a more elegant manner
Brush should only ever change the overlay, never the actual image
Brush requires access to int x, int y, Pixel(int x, int y, color), and color c, from the Pixel
float getZoom(), Pixel getPixel(int layer, int x, int y),color get(int layer, int x, int y), int layer, and EMOverlay overlay from EMImage (this.img)
void set(int layer,int x,int y,color), get(int layer,int x,int y) from EMOverlay

Brush depends on color, PImage,       color g.strokeColor, float g.strokeWeight, color g.fillColorvoid, line(int x, int y, int x2, int y2), void ellipse(int x, int y, int width, int height), void PImage.resize(int w,int h), color PImage.get(int x, int y), void PImage.set(int x,int y, color), PImage createImage(int w, int h, int colorMode),PImage loadImage(String path), image(PImage this.img, int xPos, int yPos, int xScale, int yScale), image(PImage this.img, int xPos, int yPos), color(int red, int green, int blue, int alpha) from processing 
also depends on "ui/bucket.png" in program dir
