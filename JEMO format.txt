The JEMO (J Electron Microscopy Overlay) is designed to store the overlay data created by test_environment EMImage class.
The file contains a 2-part header, the first part is 4 bytes long and contains the letters J E M O in that order (4A 45 4D 4F) to describe the file type, (there is no null terminator) followed by a 1 byte version number for the fyle type

Version 0:
The second part of the header is 16 bytes long with 4 4 byte integers, while the integers are technically signed, they should never be negative so treat them as unsigned the integers are in big endian with the low byte being the last.  The first integer is the layer the save was taken on, this can be ignored but it allows the program to immediately resume the last layer, this should not be larger than the image depth, the second number is the width in pixels of each layer of the overlay, third is the height in pixels of each layer of the overlay, lastly is the depth, the number of layers there are in the image.  The remainder of the file is uncompressed pixel colors, there should be width*height*depth*4 remaining bytes.  each pixel is divided in to 4 bytes, 1 for each color of ARGB in that order (alpha is the first byte, blue is the last) the pixels start from the top left pixel on the 0 layer and move horizontally across the screen until there are width of them and then start a new line, when there are height lines, the next layer starts at the top left, and so on until the last layer is finished.
