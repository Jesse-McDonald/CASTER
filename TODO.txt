This is just my plan for the next steps of CASTER

add scale slider to 3d view
add measure tool to ui
export project file button
verify project import
migrate edgeFinder toolbar to 2nd window

server based landmark allignment
add multiple segmentation layers (Colors) (3rd window?) (user addable, not just debug)(although the debug did teach me quite a bit)



make layer copying adjust layers to new membrane (plan is to look for closest pixel that matches the previous pixel the best, probably a quadratic or exponential distance drop off)
add Decision tree classifier
add handling of non png file types (like tif)
add import/export of track em projects
add .dm3 file handling
remove processing color as a dependancy, it is not thread safe, tColor should be a 1-1 replacement that is thread safe
