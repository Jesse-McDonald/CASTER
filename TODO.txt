This is just my plan for the next steps of CASTER

pass overlay to 3d
increse 3d performance with grid based approach

finish implimenting JEMO v.1

add multiple segmentation layers (Colors)

make layer copying adjust layers to new membrane (plan is to look for closest pixel that matches the previous pixel the best, probably a quadratic or exponential distance drop off)
add Decision tree classifier
add handling of non png file types (like tif)
add import/export of track em projects
add .dm3 file handling
