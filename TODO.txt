This is just my plan for the next steps of CASTER

Export 3d
export project file
finish implimenting JEMO v.1
migrate edgeFinder toolbar to 2nd window

external 3d viewer/display lists
server based landmark allignment
make the ui (look) great again
add multiple segmentation layers (Colors) (3rd window?)



make layer copying adjust layers to new membrane (plan is to look for closest pixel that matches the previous pixel the best, probably a quadratic or exponential distance drop off)
add Decision tree classifier
add handling of non png file types (like tif)
add import/export of track em projects
add .dm3 file handling
