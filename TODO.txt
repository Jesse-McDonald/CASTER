This is just my plan for the next steps of CASTER

Modify JEMO format to be compressed (Still lossless) by specifying a single byte before each color to indicate how many sequential pixels are of that color
add Decision tree classifier
make layer copying adjust layers to new membrane (plan is to look for closest pixel that matches the previous pixel the best, probably a quadratic or exponential distance drop off)
add handling of non png file types (like tif)
add .dm3 file handling
add import/export of track em projects
add multiple segmentation layers (Colors)
add 3d visualization
